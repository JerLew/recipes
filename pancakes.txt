In large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add milk, butter and, egg; stir until flour is moistened.
Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat until drop of water sizzles; brush lightly with oil. In batches, scoop batter by scant 1/4-cupfuls into skillet, spreading to 3 1/2 inches each. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly and edges are dry. With wide spatula, turn; cook 2 minutes more or until golden. Transfer to platter or keep warm on a cookie sheet in 225Â°F oven.
Repeat with remaining batter, brushing griddle with more oil if necessary.
